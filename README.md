## Overview

Installs/Configures hive

## Attributes

* `[:apt][:cloudera][:force_distro]`  - Override the distro name apt uses to look up repos
  Typically, leave this blank. However if (as is the case in Nov 2011) you are on natty but Cloudera's repo only has packages up to maverick, use this to override.
* `[:apt][:cloudera][:release_name]`  - Release identifier (eg cdh3u2) of the cloudera repo to use. See also hadoop/deb_version (default: "cdh3u2")

## Recipes 

* `add_cloudera_repo`        - Add Cloudera repo to package manager
* `default`                  - Base configuration for hive
